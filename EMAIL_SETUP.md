- For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- Check that 2-Factor Authentication is enabled

#### 2. "Connection timeout" error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the email service settings
- Try a different email provider

#### 3. Emails not being sent
- Check server logs for error messages
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test email configuration using the verification function

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your `.env`:
```env
DEBUG_EMAIL=true
```

This will log detailed email sending information to help troubleshoot issues.

## Production Deployment

### 1. Update Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://selfky.com
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=noreply@selfky.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-production-app-password
```

### 2. Email Service Recommendations
- **Gmail**: Good for development and small scale
- **SendGrid**: Recommended for production (free tier available)
- **Amazon SES**: Cost-effective for high volume
- **Mailgun**: Good for transactional emails

### 3. Domain Configuration
For production, consider:
- Using a custom domain for emails (e.g., noreply@selfky.com)
- Setting up SPF and DKIM records
- Configuring email authentication

## Security Considerations

### 1. Password Reset Security
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens are single-use only
- Secure token generation using crypto
- No user enumeration (same response for existing/non-existing emails)

### 2. Email Security
- Use App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- Use HTTPS for all email links
- Implement rate limiting for email requests

### 3. Data Protection
- Emails don't contain sensitive information
- Reset tokens are hashed in database
- Email addresses are validated before sending

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Email Logging
All email operations are logged:
- Successful email sends
- Failed email attempts
- Configuration errors

### 2. Monitoring
Monitor email delivery rates and bounce rates in production.

### 3. Error Handling
- Email failures don't break application functionality
- Graceful degradation when email service is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
